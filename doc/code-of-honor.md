# Provider code of honor

There are specifications on how providers are expected to operate. These specifications
are difficult to enforce because they do not pertain to interoperation. 

It is up to users to prefer operators that have good transparancy policies and build on
open source implementations which may be audited for respecting these privacy concerns.

## Storage and deduplication of received content

If providers are hosting clients (typically in the style of a web application), it is OK
to deduplicate content received by multiple users, so long as private content isn't exposed
to users who the content creator hasn't permitted to view it.  This is an agonizing topic,
but the market should create a system of reputation for providers, and users and providers
can feel free to blacklist or intensely limit the content received by entire other providers
having poor reputation.
