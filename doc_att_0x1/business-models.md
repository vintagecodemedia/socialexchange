# Business Models
There are are several sensible ways to "get in business" in the Social Exchange market.  Here are a few ideas.

## Barebone Outpost Service
While this is ideal for the most paranoid of users, it is also a the most pivotal and crucial piece of the infrastructure.  This line of business will accept customers by (if desired) vetting their merit, and managing their keys.  It will hold no data except for pending update notifications.

Other providers will post UPDATE notifications to the outpost and store them until the customer connects to the exchange and reads them.  Once the customer's client is connected and receives these notifications, it will pull the actual content from each pertinent provider (using its own outpost for some help for authentication)

## Generic web-client
If you have some ideas about some really slick UX but not interested in building out a whole new social network, you can offer a website that behaves like an always-on client on behalf of your customers.

## Competetive Provider
To compete with the existing social network market, you'll need the outpost as described above for interop, but you'll also want a website that behaves as a client, along with some giant data back ends.  You should consider allowing your outpost to support endpoint devices as well, but this is optional depending on your business model.

## Family-friendly Provider
This provider will likely want a full stack:
 * Outpost host
 * Web UI

This provider will also want to strongly verify the merit of an adult guardian and supervisor and basically create sub-accounts for children, which can be promoted when they are older.

This provider will need detailed policies about what messages are allowed in and actually presented to its users.  It will want to white-list other providers, and in some cases disallow endpoint encryption for the purpose of sanitizing bad language (probably as the supervisor account desires).
